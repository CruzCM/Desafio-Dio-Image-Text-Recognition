OCR or Optical Character Recognition is also referred to as text recognition or text extraction. Machine-leaming-based
OCR techniques allow you to extract printed or handwritten text from images such as posters, street signs and product
labels, as well as from documents like articles, reports, forms, and invoices. The text is typically extracted as words, text
lines, and paragraphs or text blocks, enabling to digital version of the scanned text. This eliminates or significantly
reduces the need for manual data entry.
