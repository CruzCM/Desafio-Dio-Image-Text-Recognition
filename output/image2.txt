What is Optical Character Recognition (OCR)?

Optical Character Recognition (OCR) is an electronic conversion of the typed,

handwritten or printed text images into machine-encoded text.

With OCR a huge number of paper-based documents, across multiple languages
and formats can be digitized into machine-readable text that not only makes
storage easier but also makes previously inaccessible data available to anyone at

a click.

Just think about the amount of archive boxes full of paper that lies in a city or a

government basement.

Such images and documents can be scanned as a document, a document photo,

or a scene photo (e.g. text on signs and billboards).
